Password generator challenge week 5

This is the challenge of week 5 of the BootCamp from University of Birmingham

**User Story**

In this challenge it was requested from the BootCamp to work with a Javascript file partially filled with data to complete in order to make the generator working. Moreover, the generator must develop a random password including lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters.

This project was developed using only HTML and javascript files - with the addition of the README file explaining and discussing the challenge.

**Acceptance Criteria**

The generator was completed when the following criteria were working:

- Alert the users to insert a number of characters they want to password to be long. Inserting a number between 8 and 128.

- Alert asking the users to confirm that they want include lowercases, uppercases, numeric and special characters.

- Alert the users that they have not agreed to the minimum requirements to generate a password so they need to try again.

- The generator creates a password.
